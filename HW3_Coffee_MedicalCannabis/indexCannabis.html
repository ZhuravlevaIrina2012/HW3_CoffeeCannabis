        <h1>Medical Cannabis</h1>
        <p class="about">Preliminary evidence suggests that cannabis can reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy,
            improve
            appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, reduces chronic pain and muscle spasms and treats severe forms of
            epilepsy.</p>

            <h3>Cannabis sativa</h3>
            <p>The flowers of Cannabis sativa are unisexual and plants are most often either male or female. It is a
                short-day flowering plant, with staminate (male) plants usually taller and less robust than pistillate
                (female or male) plants. The flowers of the female plant are arranged in racemes and can produce
                hundreds of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening on the
                female plants. Under typical conditions with a light period of 12 to 14 hours both sexes are produced in
                equal numbers because of heritable X and Y chromosomes. Although genetic factors dispose a plant to
                become male or female, environmental factors including the diurnal light cycle can alter sexual
                expression.

            <h3>Cannabis indica</h3>
            <p>In 1785, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a description of a second species of Cannabis, which he named
                Cannabis indica. Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected
                in
                India. Richard Evans Schultes described C. indica as relatively short, conical, and densely branched,
                whereas C. sativa was described as tall and laxly branched. Loran C. Anderson described C. indica plants
                as having short, broad leaflets whereas those of C. sativa were characterized as relatively long and
                narrow. Cannabis indica plants conforming to Schultes's and Anderson's descriptions originated from
                the Hindu Kush mountain range. Because of the often harsh and variable (extremely cold winters, and warm
                summers) climate of those parts, C. indica is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates.</p>

            <h3>Cannabis ruderalis</h3>
            <p>Cannabis ruderalis, or C. sativa subsp. sativa var. spontanea, is a low-THC variety or subspecies of
                Cannabis which is native to Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. Many scholars accept Cannabis
                ruderalis as its own species due to its unique traits and phenotypes which distinguish it from Cannabis
                indica and Cannabis sativa; however, it is widely debated by many other scholars as to whether or not
                ruderalis is a subspecies of Cannabis sativa.
